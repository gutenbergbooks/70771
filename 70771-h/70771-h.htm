<h3>THE SHEPHERD. A GIRL.</h3>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Shepherd.</i> Thus found he his loved Galatea fled<br></span>
<span class="i0">With Acis! What rage ensued thou knowest.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Deceived, dejected, foiled, and overthrown<br></span>
<span class="i0">In hoarse distraction a full sev’n days’ term<br></span>
<span class="i0">He ranged, but on the eighth no more was glimpsed<br></span>
<span class="i0">Striding from vale to vale nor, raging, heard<br></span>
<span class="i0">Splintering the pine-slope nigh the precipice<br></span>
<span class="i0">With fist far flung nor with a desolate<br></span>
<span class="i0">Thunder of voice, volleyed from scarp to jag,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Dislodging from steep snowfields friths compact<br></span>
<span class="i0">In downward avalanche: less loud than he.<br></span>
<span class="i0">And no tide had we of him, save by chance<br></span>
<span class="i0">The while I wandered seeking a strayed goat<br></span>
<span class="i0">Through seaward vales, I happen’d on him.<br></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2"><i>Girl.</i> <span style="margin-left: 6em;">Ah!</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Lubberly still poor wretch? or quiet grown?<br></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2"><i>Shepherd.</i> He on an ocean pinnacle of rock<br></span>
<span class="i0">Sat, scowling, motionless. In truth he seemed<br></span>
<span class="i0">Rather a further buttress of the crag<br></span>
<span class="i0">Than a giant, helpless and unhappy being.<br></span>
<span class="i0">About his brooding bulk all day the birds,<br></span>
<span class="i0">The slippery swallow, the pois’d martin,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Lifted or swept a-scatter ev’n as when,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Chatting, such gad around the ravaged mien<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of the colossal Pharaoh or twin gods<br></span>
<span class="i0">Hawk-headed and immense of ancient Egypt.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_42">{42}</a></span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Thus grieved he. And the huge begnarlèd hands<br></span>
<span class="i0">Pillared his jaw. A chillness gloomed his face<br></span>
<span class="i0">As on bare hills shadow of moveless cloud.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Nor spake he aught. But when the sun raged high<br></span>
<span class="i0">Grappling a rock he dashed it ’gainst his breast<br></span>
<span class="i0">And roared till the golden-green sea blackened<br></span>
<span class="i0">And spouting drove, loud with careering gulls,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Before his gusty breath; but passion spent<br></span>
<span class="i0">Dropping then pined, while from the single eye<br></span>
<span class="i0">One tear, as huge and hot as Phlegethon,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Fell in a hissing flood.<br></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2"><i>Girl.</i> <span style="margin-left: 6em;">Alas, poor brute!</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">And yet I laugh.<br></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2"><i>Shepherd.</i> <span style="margin-left: 6em;">Longtime in sufferance</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Bowed he his massy head, quite dumb with grief.<br></span>
<span class="i0">But, at the last, confusedly arousing<br></span>
<span class="i0">His sluggish hands, groped for and found his pipes<br></span>
<span class="i0">Twin, dry, boughless trunks of beech fire-hollowed<br></span>
<span class="i0">And with huge cinder bored. This pair he set<br></span>
<span class="i0">To cave-like mouth, then, pursing hairy lips,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Vented, with monster fingers laid on stops,<br></span>
<span class="i0">His heart’s deep sorrow: ’twas a wounding sound.<br></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2"><i>Girl.</i> And was it angry, then, the giant’s plaint?<br></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2"><i>Shepherd.</i> Angry ’twas not: though anger in it spake<br></span>
<span class="i0">As of a rebel turning eye to heav’n<br></span>
<span class="i0">With moody imprecation natural<br></span>
<span class="i0">To one so crossed from birth. Melancholy<br></span>
<span class="i0">Lent majesty to strains uncouth. He mourned<br></span>
<span class="i0">The gift of might which is his mightiest foe.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Mourned! though the dire pipes themselves rebelling<br></span>
<span class="i0">Came apt not to his hand. With rage he shook<br></span>
<span class="i0">Yet, obstinate, subdued them to his mood<br></span>
<span class="i0">So that they brimmed the dusky lower air,<br></span>
<span class="i0">The fire-strewn skies, flushed cliffs and tawny sea<br></span>
<span class="i0">With the beauty borne of desolation.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Thus lingered he.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_43">{43}</a></span><br></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2"><i>Girl.</i> <span style="margin-left: 4em;">And of the tune itself,</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Ugly, was it?<br></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2"><i>Shepherd.</i> <span style="margin-left: 3em;">Listen: when twilight fell,</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">While the near wave lapsed with but seldom foam,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Darkling against the light foretells the moon,<br></span>
<span class="i0">He still played on. “Strange end,” thought I, “thou hast,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Poor fool whose all of life is ended now,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Saving the music thou canst make of it.”<br></span>
<span class="i0">Since, as I think, his heart is shipwrecked now:<br></span>
<span class="i0">Heart, but not song! For as the night waxed late<br></span>
<span class="i0">Somewhat of beauty found he and with beauty<br></span>
<span class="i0">Somewhat of solace. To the last I listened<br></span>
<span class="i0">The while th’ unbroken moon rocked in the tide<br></span>
<span class="i0">And multitudes of sea-sprites, glistering,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Rose up in choir, but, sudden, hushed to hear<br></span>
<span class="i0">Such grief pine on. Thus somewhat was the sound&#8212;<br></span>
<span class="i0">Like to the muffled wind among the crags<br></span>
<span class="i0">When night is clear, without or stars or moon,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And lightless clouds drift on a lightless sky;<br></span>
<span class="i0">Or as the mournful blowing of the waves,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Which in the pyloned gloom of northern cave<br></span>
<span class="i0">Nightly with flood soon-swallowed and discharge<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of pouring foam, deep tide and troubled ebb,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Makes profound plaint and dreary melody<br></span>
<span class="i0">To lightless waste, huge night and solemn stars.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Such was the Cyclops’ music.<br></span>
</div><div class="stanza">

<h2>PYGMALION</h2>

<div class="stanza">
Therefore one day, as all flesh must, she died,<br>
Just as the mowers brought the last load in<br>
From happy meadows warm with summer-tide,<br>
And through the open casement, far and thin,<br>
The nightingale’s first music did begin.<br>

“Love is the sum of this world’s whole delight,<br>
Love,” said the bird, “the ending of desire,<br>
Love brought us, timid, forth to the lovely light,<br>

Love, with whose death the songs of life expire.”<br>
</div><div class="stanza">
Yet, as the limbs turned stone and bitter-cold,<br>
Widowed Pygmalion sat beside the bed,<br>
Huddling dry-eyed to see the new grown old<br>
Again so strangely, and his clamorous head<br>
Jarred him with discourse; and at length he said:<br>
</div><div class="stanza">
“Marble, my white girl, marble! Cyprian thighs<br>
And amorous bosom all made chaste once more,<br>
As though no lips had ever kissed thine eyes<br>
To slumber&#8212;virgin as they were, before<br>
The feet of Venus glowed along the floor!...<br>
</div><div class="stanza">
“Thy beauty should have made the workman blind<br>

“When by the highways merchant folk shall go<br>
Three feet of earth above our walls and towers,<br>
And other than Grecian ships bear to and fro<br>
New wares, new men, and all as brief as flowers&#8212;<br>
Thou hadst outlasted all that time devours.<br>
</div><div class="stanza">
“But thou art dead; thou art flesh and art dead;<br>
The grave will be thy lover, thy round breast<br>
Nourish the worm, while, shred by ghastly shred,<br>
The mouth that laughed, the fingers that caressed,<br>
Wither, O dearest of my works and best!...<br>
</div><div class="stanza">
“What have I gained? some mornings when my soul<br>
Leaped out of me into the arms of day,<br>
When the world, like a chariot, span in my own control,<br>
Times when I saw the beech-tree leaves a-sway<br>
And knew how green they were and far from grey.<br>
</div><div class="stanza">
“Say I learned joy&#8212;this was indeed a gain;<br>
But can I face the reckoning unafraid?<br>
For joy I bartered, first, that ancient pain<br>
Which stabbed me into vision; next, betrayed<br>
All that men looked for in me; thus I paid.<br>
</div><div class="stanza">
“Yea, I that rated at a small amount<br>
That strange, cold jewel, purchased unawares,<br>
Men’s gratitude&#8212;I that no longer count<br>

Am doubtful now; thus the gods grant our prayers.<br>

‘Pygmalion the sculptor, where art thou?’&#8212;<br>

</div><div class="stanza">
“For good or evil still. So I return<br>
Never to that old quiet which asked no beat<br>
Of answering pulse, content alone to burn,<br>
While no fierce hand might fret thy bosom sweet,<br>
Nor any lover come betwixt thy feet.<br>

“I wrought thee for the world, and then thou wast<br>
Immortal&#8212;and I wept uncomforted;<br>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
